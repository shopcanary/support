# ShopCanary Support

### What is Canary
Canary is a powerful app that helps monitor different features on your shopify store to ensure everything is working properly

### How Canary Works
* First install the Canary application on your Shopify store

* Then our customer service team will contact you to find out what the most important features you would like monitored on your site

* The Canary team will implement the tests based on your requirements. Depending on the complexity of the tests it could take a few hours to up to a day to implement

* Once the tests are ready the Canary team will notify you that everything is ready

* Then you may schedule scans to run at any schedule of your choosing

* The results of each scan will be emailed to you and posted to the app home page
